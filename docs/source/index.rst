Drivers for AMG8833 Grid-eye Infrared Sensor 
============================================
These drivers support the `AMG8833 Infrared Array Sensor Grid-EYE <https://industrial.panasonic.com/cdbs/www-data/pdf/ADI8000/ADI8000C59.pdf>`_.

.. image:: floop-amg8833.png 

This is a grid-eye infrared camera that can measure the temperature of an 8-by-8 grid of pixels (64 total). The sensor can measure temperatures between -0 °C and 80 °C with an accuracy of 2.5 °C.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Linux device with an AMG8833 connected via I2C, such as any version of `Forward Loop Zero <https://forward-loop.com/developer.html>`_ with the optional grid-eye infrared.
- (Optional) Docker on the Linux device. We recommend you check out `floop <https://github.com/ForwardLoopLLC/floopcli>`_, our simple, open-source tool for working with embedded Docker on multiple devices at the same time.

Install
-------

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Using floop

        In order to use the drivers with floop, you configure the drivers and your application on a host device then push the source code and build instructions to each target device using floop.

        On your host, install floop using pip:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install --upgrade floopcli

        Clone the driver repository:
        
        .. code-block:: bash

            git clone --recursive https://github.com/ForwardLoopLLC/amg8833

        The clone needs to be recursive in order to clone the appropriate `I2C drivers <https://github.com/ForwardLoopLLC/i2c>`_.

        Change directory into driver directory:

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd amg8833 

        Configure floop to allow access to I2C devices on the target device. For example, if you have one target device available over SSH at the address 192.168.1.100, your **floop.json** in the **mlx90614** directory could be:

        .. literalinclude:: ../../floop.json.example

        Notice that *privileged* is true, so floop has access to target device hardware.

        In order to check that installation succeeded, you can run the simple example included in the driver repository. You will need to tell the driver which bus holds the MLX90614. 
        
        Edit the file **run.sh.linux**:
        
        .. literalinclude:: ../../run.sh.linux
       
        Make sure to change the value of `BUS` to match the bus to which your AMG8833 is connected. The value of `BUS` is the same as the integer that corresponds to the `/dev/i2c-*` entry for your device.

        Now run the example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            floop run -v

        If the example returns with no error, then the installation succeeded. 

    .. group-tab:: Header Files 

        You can install the C++ header files for use in your own applications.  

        In order to use the drivers with Linux, you need to install some I2C dependencies:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus python-dev i2c-tools libi2c-dev 

        You need to install the AMG8833 and I2C headers, then include them during compilation of your application. Inside of your application folder, you can install both headers at the same time:

        .. code-block:: bash

            mkdir -p ./floop/i2c/ && \
            mkdir -p ./floop/amg8833/ && \
            wget -O ./floop/i2c/i2c.h https://github.com/ForwardLoopLLC/i2c/blob/master/i2c/i2c.h && \
            wget -O ./floop/amg8833/amg8833.h https://github.com/ForwardLoopLLC/amg8833/blob/master/amg8833/amg8833.h

        When you compile your application, make sure to include the path to the driver headers. For example, add `-I./floop/` during compilation. You can then access the drivers by including the amg8833 header:

        .. code-block:: c++

            #include "amg8833/amg8833.h"

        Note that you can also use these steps to install the drivers inside of a Docker container.

Example
-------

The example shows the major functionality of the drivers.

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/main.cpp
